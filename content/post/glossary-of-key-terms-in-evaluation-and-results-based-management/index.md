summary: "This Glossary provides conceptual clarity on common terms used in
  results based management, monitoring and evaluation. This 2nd Edition includes
  new terms, as well as updates and improvements to the original Glossary
  published in 2002. It is intended to support thoughtful approaches to
  resultsbased management, monitoring and evaluation, which in turn support
  better progress on sustainable development through learning and
  accountability.   Members of the OECD DAC Network on Development Evaluation
  and the OECD/DAC Results Community of Practice developed the Glossary, under
  the guidance of the OECD Secretariat. The text has benefited from consultation
  with many experts and partners in the broader evaluation and results
  communities, and input from other DAC subsidiary bodies.   Note: This
  English-only prepublication version provides the full English text for
  reference. It will be replaced by the formal trilingual publication following
  translation and formatting."

This Glossary provides conceptual clarity to support thoughtful approaches to results-based management, monitoring and evaluation, which in turn support better progress on sustainable development through learning and accountability. This glossary is useful for training and in practical work on sustainable development in the public and private sectors – including during project or policy design, monitoring, programme implementation and management, and various types of evaluation.   The focus of the Glossary is on specific terms as used for results monitoring, management, data collection and analysis, and evaluation. We do not define related or general concepts – such as human rights, equity, or development – as these are defined elsewhere and used here in standard, widely accepted ways. Notes define and explain key concepts (and form part of the definitions). Cross-references point the reader to related terms and synonyms.  This second edition of the Glossary reflects learnings and context changes over the past 20 years. It incorporates new thinking from the OECD/DAC Results Community, which did not exist at the time of the first edition in 2002. It includes updates to definitions as well as new terms now in common use. Several definitions have been adjusted to reflect their current use by a range of actors in diverse contexts of work on sustainable development, including within communities. This edition also reflects the extensive work undertaken in 2017-2019 by the OECD Development Assistance Committee’s (DAC) Network on Development Evaluation to refine the definitions of the evaluation criteria originally outlined here in 2002. The adapted criteria definitions approved in 2019 are included in this updated edition.   This process has been guided by the highest considerations of clarity and conciseness. It was conducted in a spirit of compromise in terms of the willingness of partners not to impose their own specific vocabulary on others.   The original Glossary, published in 2002 was the fruit of almost two years of elaboration, based on an initial collection of terms used by development agencies. The selection of terms and their definitions were carefully discussed and analysed, and benefited from inputs from many sources and advice from the academic evaluation community. Likewise, this second edition involved extensive consultation and input from experts and partners across the results and evaluation communities.
