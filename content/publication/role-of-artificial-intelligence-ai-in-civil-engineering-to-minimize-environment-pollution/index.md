abstract: This study investigates the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
  minimizing environmental pollution within the civil engineering sectors. With
  the growing emphasis on sustainability and environmental protection, AI
  presents an innovative approach to reducing resource consumption, waste
  generation, and pollution in construction and urban development. The research
  explores various applications of AI, including resource optimization, waste
  reduction, energy efficiency, smart infrastructure, and real-time
  environmental pollution monitoring. Key findings suggest that AI technologies
  contribute to improved sustainability by optimizing material usage, enhancing
  recycling processes, and reducing energy consumption in buildings and
  infrastructure. Additionally, AI-powered systems enable accurate pollution
  monitoring and forecasting, allowing for timely interventions. However,
  challenges such as high implementation costs, lack of standardized data, and
  resistance to technological adoption hinder widespread implementation. The
  study concludes that while AI holds substantial promise in promoting
  environmentally sustainable practices, overcoming these barriers will be
  essential for its broader adoption in civil engineering.
