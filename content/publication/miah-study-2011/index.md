abstract: The study area comprises Rajshahi University Campus. The study covers an area of more then 3 sq. km and extends from the Rajshahi-Dhaka a highway in the south to the Iswardi-Amnura Railway line in the east. Tectonically it occupies part of the stable shelf zone of the Bengal Basin. Pliocene deposits form the principle aquifer of the area. Subsurface geology comprises of low permeable clay, silt and silty clay of Modhupur clay formation of Pleistocene and Holocene age. Subsurface hydrogeologic cross section and Dupitila sandstone of Pliocene age has good aquifer potentially. The major objectives of the work are to prepare to delineate the subsurface lithologies with the help of electrical resistivity survey. It also deals with the correlation of the inferred lithologies with existing water table location and delineate fresh water zones in the aquifer. According to the geoelectric resistivity survey of the IBS (NS) section are more than 100 m depth and we get multi-layered of section. The lithology of the section is mainly dominated by fine to coarse sand, silty clay and clay. From the lithologic and hydrogeological discussions of different layers of the study area it can be concluded that the Zone IV constitute the main aquifer in this section where resistivity value is representative for fresh accumulation and appreciable thickness of this aquifers indicate that for economic exploitation of groundwater well can be developed here with high capacity. In addition, almost similar resistivity values of zone II with less thickness and medium sand layer of zone IV with lower resistivity value also indicate of shallow and deep aquifer.
