abstract: 
This study investigates the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in minimizing environmental pollution within the civil engineering sectors. With the growing emphasis on sustainability and environmental protection, AI presents an innovative approach to reducing resource consumption, waste generation, and pollution in construction and urban development. The research explores various applications of AI, including resource optimization, waste reduction, energy efficiency, smart infrastructure, and real-time environmental pollution monitoring. Key findings suggest that AI technologies contribute to improved sustainability by optimizing material usage, enhancing recycling processes, and reducing energy consumption in buildings and infrastructure. Additionally, AI-powered systems enable accurate pollution monitoring and forecasting, allowing for timely interventions. However, challenges such as high implementation costs, lack of standardized data, and resistance to technological adoption hinder widespread implementation. The study concludes that while AI holds substantial promise in promoting environmentally sustainable practices, overcoming these barriers will be essential for its broader adoption in civil engineering.![Read](https://doi.org/10.30574/wjarr.2024.24.3.3748)
