As an Environmental Specialist with a passion for sustainability, I bring over 6 years of experience working at the intersection of climate change, water resources, and community resilience in South Asia. With a foundation in hydrogeology and strong skills in data analytics, M&E, and GIS, I thrive on turning complex environmental data into actionable insights that help drive positive change. I've been fortunate to collaborate with diverse teams in government and NGOs like DASCOH, SRC, Water Relief, and Bangladesh’s Ministry of Land, contributing to projects that build climate-adaptive solutions and protect vulnerable communities. I’m eager to connect with like-minded professionals and continue growing my impact in the sustainable development space.
